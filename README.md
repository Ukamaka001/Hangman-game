How to Play

The game will display a series of underscores representing the hidden word.
Enter a letter to guess a letter in the word.
If the guessed letter is in the word, it will be revealed in the correct positions.
If the guessed letter is not in the word, a part of the hangman will be drawn.
Continue guessing letters until you either guess the entire word or the hangman is completely drawn (maximum 6 incorrect guesses).
After the game ends, you will have the option to play again.
